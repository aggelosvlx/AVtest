## Steps I Took
- I generated an SSH key using the command from the pico.sh FAQ.
- I registered on pico.sh and set up my username.
- I downloaded the required HTML file from the given link.
- I uploaded the HTML file to pico.sh using `rsync`.
- I created a GitHub repository and uploaded all required files.

## Decisions
- I followed the pico.sh documentation closely.
- I used rsync for uploading because it was recommended.

## Prompts Used
-" Take all the files I will give you and carefully make a guide on how to solve this project. I'm young, so teach me; I know nothing about code."
- Explain me what each command does so i cannot just complete the task but also understand it completely
